# PBT - Propeller Front-End Build Test
By Jarkko Sibenberg

For the slider I have used [Owl Carousel](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/). Everything else is pretty much written from scratch. I created a Codepen for practising the mobile nav. You can find it [here on Codepen](http://codepen.io/jarkko/pen/KzOvxX).

I also didn't construct the gulpfile myself. It is something I have used on several projects before this one.

Because of time restrictions I didn't look into hooking up Twitter and Instagram APIs.
